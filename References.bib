  abstract = {Relative survival rates, such as 5- or 10-year relative survival rates, which quantify "net survival" of cancer patients, are the most commonly reported measures of cancer outcome by cancer registries. Because relative survival rates vary with age for many forms of cancer, and because the age distribution of cancer patients varies between different populations or within one population over time, age adjustment of relative survival rates is often employed in international comparisons or in time series analyses of cancer patient survival. In this article, we show that derivation of crude and of age-adjusted relative survival rates in the traditional way is conceptually inconsistent, and that this inconsistency has important practical implications. We show ways to overcome this inconsistency in the derivation and interpretation of crude and age-adjusted relative survival rates.},

  abstract = {Recently, 2 modeling strategies have been proposed and shown to be useful to increase precision of up-to-date cancer survival estimates and to predict cancer patient survival: modeled period analysis and modeled cohort analysis. We aimed to compare the performance of both types of modeling for providing up-to-date and precise cancer survival estimates. Data from the nationwide Finnish Cancer Registry were used to assess how well both approaches would have been able to predict 5-year relative survival of concurrently diagnosed patients if they had been applied for that purpose throughout the past decades. Analyses were carried out for 20 common forms of cancer. For each cancer, 5-year relative survival was modeled with either approach for each single calendar year from 1962 to 1997. Mean differences and mean squared differences from 5-year relative survival later observed for patients diagnosed in the 5-year period around those calendar years were calculated. Survival estimates obtained by period modeling had much lower standard errors than those obtained by cohort modeling. Furthermore, for a clear majority of cancers, period modeling on average also provided better prediction of 5-year relative survival than cohort modeling. We conclude that, although both modeling strategies have their merits and specific indications, period modeling of survival has distinct advantages for up-to-date and precise estimation of cancer survival in population-based cancer survival studies.

  abstract = {PURPOSE: Provision of up-to-date long-term survival curves is an important task of cancer registries. Traditionally, survival curves have been derived for cohorts of patients diagnosed many years ago. Using data of the Finnish Cancer Registry, we provide an empirical assessment of the use of a new method of survival anlysis, denoted period analysis, for deriving more up-to-date survival curves. PATIENTS AND METHODS: We calculated 10-year relative survival curves actually observed for patients diagnosed with one of the 15 most common forms of cancer in 1983 to 1987, and we compared them with the most up-to-date 10-year relative survival curves that might have been obtained in 1983 to 1987 using either traditional (cohort-wise) or period analysis. We also give the most recent 10-year survival curves obtained by period analysis for the 1993 to 1997 period. RESULTS: For all forms of cancer, period analysis of the 1983 to 1987 data yielded survival curves that were very close to the survival curves later observed for patients who were newly diagnosed in that period (median and maximum difference of 10-year relative survival estimates: 0.9 and 5.7 percent units, respectively). By contrast, the survival curves obtained by traditional (cohort-wise) survival analysis in 1983 to 1987 would have been much lower for most forms of cancer (median and maximum difference: 5.8 and 18.4 percent units, respectively). The 10-year survival curves for the 1993 to 1997 period are substantially more favorable than previously available, traditionally derived survival curves for most forms of cancer. CONCLUSION: Period analysis is a useful tool for deriving up-to-date long-term survival curves of patients with cancer.},

  abstract = {When estimating patient survival using data collected by population-based cancer registries, it is common to estimate net survival in a relative-survival framework. Net survival can be estimated using the relative-survival ratio, which is the ratio of the observed survival of the patients (where all deaths are considered events) to the expected survival of a comparable group from the general population. In this article, we describe a command, strs, for life-table estimation of relative survival. We discuss three methods for estimating expected survival, as well as the cohort, period, and hybrid approaches for estimating relative survival. We also implement a life-table version of the Pohar Perme (2012, Biometrics 68: 113?120) estimator of net survival, and we describe two methods for age standardization. We also explain how, in addition to net probabilities of death, crude probabilities of death due to cancer and due to other causes can be estimated using the method of Cronin and Feuer (2000, Statistics in Medicine 19: 1729?1740). We conclude this article with discussion and examples of modeling excess mortality using various approaches, including the full-likelihood approach (using the ml command) and Poisson regression (using the glm command with a user-specified link function).},
